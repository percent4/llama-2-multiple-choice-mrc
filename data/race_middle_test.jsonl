Success belongs to those who are willing to go after it and try their best to do what they have to do. Here are some useful practical ways for you if you want to be a success.\nDesire. Desire is the strong wish to achieve a goal. Without desire you have nothing. Before you can run with desire, your goal must be plain, clear, and it must also be exciting.\nShow up. Seventy percent of success in life is showing up. You can't have a best seller, if you have never written a book. You can't get your dream job, if you're afraid to turn in an application. Showing up doesn't guarantee  success, but if you don't show up, you won't succeed.\nFail. Unless you're willing to have a try, fail unhappily, and have another try, success won't happen. To have success you have to do things the right way, but often the only way to do something right is to first fail at it. As Thomas J. Watson said, a simple formula   for success is to double your rate of failure  . So welcome failure, become a student of failure, learn from failure, and soon you will succeed.\nWork Harder. _ Success is not about doing what the common person can't do. It's about doing what the common person is unwilling to do. And on a deeper level, it's about creating habits that the common person is unwilling to create. It's the habit of doing things with excellence that causes success.\nEnjoy the Journey. Success is a journey, not a destination  . Success is not a certain car or a certain house or a certain happy marriage. Success is the enjoyment of the journey. You have to enjoy the journey.\nSomeone once said, \"Unless you change how you are, you will always have what you've got.\" You have to change, you will change, and you will succeed.\n\n<question>:\nWhich of the following is NOT mentioned in achieving success?\n\n<options>:\nA Working hard.\nB Good education.\nC Strong desire.\nD Enjoying failure.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "B"}]}

As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level.\nWhether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die.\n\n<question>:\nAccording to the passage, how can we solve the problems around Lake Victoria?\n\n<options>:\nA People must build more power plants.\nB More sources of water must be found.\nC Every country should offer some money to Africa.\nD All the people living in the area should move to another place.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "B"}]}

It is often spent travelling or working. It can give young people useful learning experiences and new skills.\nGap years are popular with European and Australian students, but remain less popular in America. However, in recent years, more and more American students are preparing for college by taking a gap year. The advantages of taking a gap year are as follows:\nLearn about the World and Yourself\nAlthough you don't have to go abroad to experience gap years, most gap year students catch the chance to travel abroad. You are able to work out who you are and what you are for. The experiences of different cultures offer you interesting lessons. You can learn more about the world and get to know yourself better.\nFace Challenges and Have Fun\nA gap year is not only a time to take a vacation, but also a time to face challenges. Gap year students usually work, volunteer or take service projects. You have to learn how to get along in the real world. This process isn't always easy, but it is an important part of growing up. Only in this way can you enjoy life and have fun.\nSave Money and Improve Your College Admission Chances\nThere's a common thought that gap years are only for rich students,but it' s not true. Actually, taking a gap year can save your money. Gap year students often take a part-time job. Besides, at the end of a gap year, students are much more likely to know what to study in college.

The restaurant is in eastern downtown Beijing. It's the first eat-in-the-dark restaurant in China, and also in Asia. The restaurant is so welcome, since it's open in January at jianwai SOHO in Chaoyang District.\nPeople going there will experience darkness both during the day and the night. The restaurant offers not only a wonderful choice for food, but also a special environment for friends or parties.\nEvery day, Whale Inside receives at least 50 guests from everywhere around Beijing. About 10 per cent of them are foreigners.\nThe customers will go to the light to see the menu, and then they have to hand in all mobile phones, watches and other things that can give off light. They then move to the dark world. Waiters will lead them to the dark dining area. Of course, the waiters are all wearing special glasses that can make them see in the dark.

Birds, fish and other animals move from one place to another at a certain time. They move for different reasons: most of them move to find food more easily, but others move to get away from places that are too crowed.\nWhen cold weather comes, many birds move to warmer places to find food. Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed. The most famous migration   is probably the migration of the fish, which is called \"salmon\" . This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water. There it spends its life. When it is cold, it returns to its birthplace in fresh water. Then it gives birth and dies there. In northern Europe, there is a kind of mouse. They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded. They move down to the low land. Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside, and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea.\nRecently, scientists have studied the migration of a kind lobster  . Every year, when the season of bad weather arrives, the lobster get into a long time and start to walk across tile floor of the ocean. Nobody knows why they do this, and nobody knows where they go.\nSo, sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another, but at other times we don't.

A large tree grew there. Both the patch and the tree gave the place a wonderful look, and they were the pride  of the gardener. But no one know that the vegetables and the tree couldn't stand   each other. The vegetables hated the tree's shadow   , because it left them only just enough light to live. The tree, on the other hand, hated the vegetables because they drank nearly all the water, leaving him just enough to live.\nTheir problem became so serious that the vegetables decided to use up all the water in the ground so that the tree would die. The tree answered back by not protecting the vegetables from the hot sun, so they began to dry up. Soon the vegetables were really weak, and the tree was drying up.\nThe gardener wondered why and stopped watering them.

The price of the watch is from $349 to $1,099, depending on its size and whether it is a sports or regular one.\nApple engineers and designers have put in a lot of thought and hard work into creating this \"small screen\" on your wrist .  The \"sensor \" on the screen not only finds your finger, but also knows the difference between when you are tapping , and when you are pressing hard er.\nThe watch also has \"haptic feedback \". You can s end personal messages to your friend --such as drawing a star or a special sign with your fingers, or tapping the watch, say 3 times, and your friend will receive those taps on their wrist.\nBesides telling the time, the watch will use 'Bluetooth' to connect with your iPhone and show calls or text messages that come in.\nAccording to Tim Cook, the watch may open up a whole new area of applications  that we had never thought of. Some car f actories like BMW have developed an app that allows its car owners to open their cars with the watch. A 'Hotels' app may allow you to open the door to your hotel room without worrying about losing the smart-card. And finally, even at the airport--passengers may be able to simply wave their wrist to check into their flight.\nThe biggest use of the watch, however, is as your personal fitness coach. The watch can show your pulse (heartbeat) using a sensor at the bottom of the watch.

Maybe the earth gets warmer and warmer on its own. But many scientists say that people are doing many things which makes the earth warmer.\nFirst, greenhouse effect   is a very important reason for the change of the earth. People give out too much energy into the air every year. It makes the earth warmer. Climate   change is another important reason. Sometimes it becomes too hot and sometimes too cold. Sometimes there is too much rain and sometimes too little. The change of the climate makes the earth warmer. In turn, the warmth of the earth changes the climate, too.\nWhen the earth becomes warmer, there may be more rain and a rise in sea level. It will affect the growth of plants, animals and people. On a Pacific island, 100 people have to move to higher ground because the sea is rising. These people can no longer live on the coast. Before that, two islands without people went underwater in 1999.

At an early age we encourage children to behave like adults, just because we find it funny. The kids on the other hand consider this same behavior as normal and get used to it. And when it is not funny for us any more, we expect them to stop it, but by then it is already too late. Only when they reach a certain maturity  will the children realize that answering back and being rude are not acceptable . Until then, most of the time their behavior is difficult to change, unless by force . And use of force is against the every good idea, as it weakens the child's confidence.\nSo it is one thing to bring a child into this world but quite another to make them into well mannered citizens.

A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. \"You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,\" said the woman. \"It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me. I only ask one day you will pass it on. When you grow up, I would like you to find someone you can help. When you help others, I know you will feel as good about it as I do now.\"\nMark took the money, dried his tears and ran back to the checkout counter as fast as he could. That year we all enjoyed our gifts almost as much as Mark enjoyed giving them to us.\nI would like to say \"thank you\" to that very kind woman, and tell her that four years later, Mark went house to house collecting blankets and clothes for the homeless people in the fire. And I want to promise her that Mark will never forget to keep passing\non.\n\n<question>:\nWhat's the best title for this passage?\n\n<options>:\nA A broken pocket\nB A kind woman\nC A happy family\nD A wonderful gift\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers.\nQ: Why is the sky blue?\nA: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \"raised area\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules   because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters   it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue.\nQ:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime?\nA: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us.\nQ: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter?\nA: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months.\n\n<question>:\nThe sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight  _  .\n\n<options>:\nA has the longest wavelength among all the colors\nB cannot be taken in by the gas molecules\nC doesn't hit \"raised area\" in the atmosphere\nD cannot pass through space successfully\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}

That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue.\nQ:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime?\nA: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us.\nQ: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter?\nA: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months.\n\n<question>:\nWhat is NOT explained in the passage?\n\n<options>:\nA Why is the sky blue?\nB Why is the moon able to be seen during the daytime?\nC Why do birds travel in winter?\nD Where do honeybees go in winter?\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "C"}]}

But if you think you need lots of luck, what else might you do?\nIn the UK and US there are some strange traditions for bringing yourself a little more good luck. Some are hundreds of years old and some are much newer.\nHave you heard the saying \"When you wish upon a star\"? If you are looking up at the sky on a clear night and you see a sudden flash of light, it is probably a shooting star! Seeing one doesn't happen very often. The saying goes that if you see one you have been very lucky, and so if you make a wish, it will come true.\nMaybe you have heard of the lucky rabbit's foot. Some people believe that rabbits are lucky animals, so they carry a part of the rabbit, its foot, for good luck. There are all kinds of strange, unclear rules about which of the rabbit's feet is the luckiest. It is said that this good luck tradition is the oldest one of all. However, as the funny saying goes, \"Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit!\"\nPeople in Britain love trees. If it is autumn and leaves are falling from the trees, some people try to catch the leaves as they fall because they think each leaf they catch will bring _ a lucky month in the following year--they will need to catch 12 falling leaves to have a whole of good luck!\n\n<question>:\nBritish people try to catch 12 falling leaves because   _  .\n\n<options>:\nA the leaves fall in autumn\nB there are so many leaves to catch\nC the leaves can bring them a lucky month\nD they want to have a whole year of good luck\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}

In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating  in zero gravity .\nHowever, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.\nOf course, astronauts can still produce tears . But crying is much more difficult in space, according to The Atlantic  in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow  down out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go -- they just stick  to your eyes.\nIn May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. \"Tears,\" he said, \"don't fall off of your eyes. They just stay there.\"\nBesides making your vision  unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case  in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. \"My right eye is stinging  like crazy,\" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.\nSince gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of  the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe  the tears away. Another choice is to just wait -- \"When the tears get big enough, they simply break free of the eyes and float around,\" astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.\nThere are lots of small things -- things like crying -- that we are so used to on Earth. We usually _ until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up  everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.\nTherefore, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say, \"Gravity, you're the best.\"\n\n<question>:\nWhat effect do tears have on astronauts?\n\n<options>:\nA They cause physical pain.\nB They bring comfort to them.\nC They make their vision clearer.\nD They float around and cause trouble.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "A"}]}

Very few people would think of a library as a place to live in.\nOne library in New York City turned into a home for 250 people for a few days. These were all people near the library. They slept on the floor. Why did the people move into the library?\nThe people moved into the library because the city wanted to close it to save money. These 250 New Yorkers loved their library. They didn't want to lose it. So they moved in. They knew that the library couldn't be closed if they were living inside it. At last the city agreed to keep the library open, and the people all went home.\n\n<question>:\nFrom the passage we know that   _  .\n\n<options>:\nA the library was kept open at last\nB the library was closed because no one read in it\nC the library became a home of these people\nD the city saved a lot of money\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "A"}]}

Colorful creations of different shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds flying and dancing. As the strong winds blew against the kites, a string kept them in control.\nInstead of blowing away with the wind, they rose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the restraining   string and the cumbersome   tail kept them in control, facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled against the string, they seemed to say, \"Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!\" They rose beautifully even when they fought the _ of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose . \"Free at last,\" it seemed to say. \"Free to fly with the wind.\"\nYet freedom  simply put it in the control of an unkind wind. It fell down to the ground and landed in a mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. \"Free at last\", free to lie powerlessly in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and to stop lifelessly against the first obstacle  .\nHow much like kites we sometimes are. The Heaven gives us adversity   and rules, rules to follow from which we can grow and get strength. Some of us break away from the rules so hard that we never reach the heights we might get to. We keep part of the rules and never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground.\nLet us each rise to the great heights, knowing that some of the rules that we may be angry about are in fact the strong force that helps us achieve.\n\n<question>:\nIn the writer's opinion,   _  .\n\n<options>:\nA without restrictions and rules we can make endless progress\nB kites are good examples to those who want to get freedom\nC restrictions are necessary for us human beings\nD we don't need any freedom at all\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "B"}]}

They fear the language could become corrupted .\nEveryone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\nLinguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs.\nHowever, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\"\nPerhaps, we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Text is just for fun.\"\n\n<question>:\nWhat can be the best title for the passage?\n\n<options>:\nA Netspeak: A Widely-Used Language on Internet\nB Is Netspeak Harming the English Language?\nC Is Netspeak Helpful in Language Learning?\nD Netspeak Advantages and Disadvantages\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "B"}]}

They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen  and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section.\nMost spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food.

They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs.
