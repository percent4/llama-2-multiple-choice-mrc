Animals get their food by eating plants and other animals. Therefore animals and man need plants in order to live. This is why we find that there are so many plants around us.\nIf you look carefully at the plants around you, you will find that there are two kinds of plants: flowering plants and non-flowering  plants.\nFlowering plants can make seeds .

An example of a fruit without seeds is the banana fruit.\nMost non-flowering plants do not grow from seeds. They grow from spores . Spores are very, very small.

If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor.

If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it.

The first are those that give a personal, subjective  idea of travels which their writer has got himself. These books can be useful if the writers share their traveling experiences with others. The second kind are those books which give objective  information of things to be done and seen. If _ has written such a book about the facts of a place, then it is more useful.

But now theold also take part in this activity.\nIt is now possible to exchange \"red envelopes\" with smartphone, which is popular in China and has caused a battle  for the _ market between the two companies providing the service, Tencent and Alibaba.\n\"You don't have to pay the same cost or wait as long as you would for a traditional bank transfer . It's more convenient, simple and fun,\" Wang Le, a 28-year-old Beijinger, told AFP. \" With electronic red envelopes, you're not limited by your identity  or the time of year. It's a new, fresh way of playing the game.\"\nThe idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system with over 400 million users and run[:**]by Tencent, China's largest Internet service system.

So why don't we learn to code   computer programs too? What coding has in common with writing, playing music and creating art is that it lets you bring your ideas to life. Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding.

What's the difference between fog and smog?\nAccording to scientists, fog is made up of tiny   drops of water and also ice particles   during very cold conditions.

PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\nPoor air has done harm to people's health.

A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from December 5 to December 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.\nAir problems and environmental protection have become a care for the whole nation.\nPremier Li Keqiang made his last Government Work Report  on March 6, 2014. The report said that the government should work hard to prevent pollution and give people a healthy living environment.\nIt calls on people to make full use of energy and resources   and cut down on energy use.\n'We should give people hope through our actions,' Li said.\n\n<question>:\nFrom Li Keqiang's report, we learn that   _  .\n\n<options>:\nA the environment has improved a lot since Li was in office\nB many people have breathing problems because of the air pollution\nC the air pollution problem is the government's task\nD the government will try its best to solve the air pollution problem\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}

She took a job in consulting ,but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income by teaching students.

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps.

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them. Each month, two million pages are visited on the website TrainWeb.org.\n340words\n\n<question>:\nWhat do we learn from the passage?\n\n<options>:\nA Train-spotters in the UK want to fool people.\nB Train-spotting is more acceptable in America.\nC Train-spotters are much stranger than car lovers.\nD Train-spotting relates to(...)a dangerous lifestyle.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "B"}]}

It's very different from what I learned at school! Students in my group are from different cities of Britain and their dialects   are different too! Some of their accents   are quite strong and they also have their own words and expressions.\nBut it's not the language that's different and surprising. Before I came to England I had thought that fish and chips were eaten every day. That's quite wrong! I get rather mad now when I hear all the foolish words about typical   English food.\nI had expected to see \"London fog\". Do you remember our texts about it? We had no idea that most of this 'thick fog' disappeared many years ago when people stopped using coal in their homes. But the idea to speak about the weather was very helpful. The weather in London is really changeable.\nOn the other hand habits are different. People tell me what is typically British here in London is not always typical in Wales or Scotland. Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions. Probably Britain has more living signs of its past than many other countries. And people have always been proud of having ancient buildings in capitals, big cities and the countryside.\nI will tell you more about Britain in my other letters.\nLove from Britain,\nPeter\n\n<question>:\nWhich is NOT true according to the passage?\n\n<options>:\nA What he's seen is quite different from what he'd learned\nB British people like to follow traditions.\nC Peter had learned about Britain before.\nD Peter doesn't like his life in Britain.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}

I'm not allowed to stay out as late as my friends do, so I can't have any fun. My parents only seem to care about my school grades. Although I love them, sometimes I feel we live in different worlds.

You see, your parents have grown up at a different time and they have different experiences. So, they think some things are strange, but you find the same things are all right.

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students.

Most of the letters he received were interesting and quite easy to answer. Then came a letter from a person named Joe.\n\"Dear Amy,\" it began, \"I'm in real trouble.

For example, geese  fly in noisy, \"V\"-shaped groups. Other kinds of birds fly alone.\nSome animals stay active in winter. They must change themselves as the weather changes. Many change their doing or their bodies. For example, snowshoe rabbits grow white fur to help them hide in the snow.\nFood is hard to find in winter. Some animals, like mice, collect lots of food in autumn and store it to eat later. Some animals eat different kinds of food as the seasons change.\nSome animals hibernate for part or all of the winter. This is a special, very deep sleep. The animal's body temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. It uses very little energy. In autumn, these animals get ready for winter by eating much more food than in summer and storing it as body fat.

With the help of a team of scientists and engineers, he is sure that the device can be worked outside.\n\"Beijing is a very good place to test the device because the smog in Beijing is quite low and there's not so much wind.\" says Roosegaarde. \"We'll be able to make the air pure but the most difficult thing is to remove the smog. As a result, you can see the sun again.\"\nRoosegaarde also reminds us that his aim is not only to give a plan to solve Beijing's dirty air pollution but also to make people pay attention to the environment problem. He adds, \"This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer to do with it is clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles. \" However, he hopes the project will make the citizens realize the differences between clean air and smog-filled air.\n\n<question>:\nRoosegaarde hopes people in Beijing can  _  .\n\n<options>:\nA pay attention to air pollution and solve the problem finally\nB invent more devices to clean the smog in Beijing\nC drive modern cars and try different lifestyles\nD realize how serious the pollution they're facing is\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "A"}]}

It comes from the Greek words that mean \"to write with light\". But photography could only give people _ pictures. So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\nBack in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\nAt that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\nThough is usually considered as the person who created the first movie in 1889, it was the work of Eadweard Muybridge and the bet that led to Edison's invention.\n\n<question>:\nWhat did Leland Stanford make a bet with his friend about?\n\n<options>:\nA Whose horse ran faster.\nB whether a horse would fall over while running.\nC whether it was possible for scientists to make moving pictures.\nD Whether a horse's hooves all left the ground at the same time while running.\n\n<answer>:\n", "assistant": "D"}]}
